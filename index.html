          <p>Prior to my journey of becoming an frontend web developer, I have learned 1-2 years of basic&intermediate Python and Java in my first few years in college. But the topics and concepts in the backend area was hard for me to fully understand. I starting learning frontend development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and quickly realized that it was easier to fully understand and I acutally have an interest in this field.

        <div class="about-me">
          <p>Currently I am a senior in college with 1 year left till graduation and hope to find my first frontend job soon. My current plan is to eventually learn backend fully after mastering frontend development so I can be a full-stack developer.
